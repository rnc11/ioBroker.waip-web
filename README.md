Unofficial ioBroker adapter for **Wachalarm IP-Web (WAIP-Web)**

Connects via Socket.IO to a WAIP-Web dispatch monitor and mirrors incidents
("Einsatz"), responder feedback ("Rückmeldung"), routes and TTS
announcements into ioBroker states – without needing a browser tab to stay
open.

## About this adapter

This adapter is an **unofficial community project** and has no connection
to the WAIP-Web project, to Robert-112, or to the operator of any specific
instance (e.g. the Integrated Regional Dispatch Center Lausitz /
Integrierte Regionalleitstelle Lausitz). It was built by analyzing the
behavior of the frontend (`client_waip.js`) that a WAIP-Web instance
publicly serves to any browser, in order to replicate the same Socket.IO
events and data fields a regular browser client receives.

The adapter connects **without logging in** and therefore only ever
receives WAIP-Web's public permission tier (keyword, location, approximate
position, alerted resources, feedback) – the same data any anonymous
browser visitor would see without signing in. No access restrictions are
bypassed.

> **Note:** An always-on automated client like this adapter is different
> from an occasionally opened browser tab. Before running it against a
> production instance, briefly check with the operator/your dispatch
> center whether a permanent automated connection is welcome.

## About WAIP-Web

[Wachalarm IP-Web](https://github.com/Robert-112/n112_waip-web) is an
open-source web application by **Robert-112** that displays dispatch/alert
information for fire departments and EMS device-independently in the
browser (Windows, Linux, Mac, smartphone – no installation needed). Among
other things it offers:

- **Alarm monitor** – incident type, keyword, special signal, location,
  map, alerted resources, app-based responder feedback including voice
  announcements
- **Dashboard** – overview of all ongoing incidents
- **Feedback function** – app-based responder feedback, grouped by role
  (EK/GF/ZF/VF) and additional qualification (AGT/FZF/MA/MED)
- **Administration** – user management, station data, monitor overview

WAIP-Web itself is licensed under
[**Creative Commons BY-SA 4.0**](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).
This adapter contains no code from the WAIP-Web project; it implements an
independent client for its Socket.IO interface.

## Practical use cases

This section is about what you can actually *build* with the states this
adapter provides – typical use in a fire station/EMS environment:

- **Wall-mounted alarm display.** Bind `einsatz.json.current` to a VIS
  table widget on a wall-mounted tablet or TV in the day room/vehicle
  hall – incident type, keyword, address and alerted resources appear
  automatically, without anyone having to keep a browser tab open on that
  screen (which is the whole reason this adapter exists in the first
  place).
- **Plain-language keyword on displays and notifications.**
  `einsatz.beschreibung` turns a cryptic dispatch code (`B:Wald groß/WSP`,
  `R1N0`) into a readable description ("Wald-/Getreidefeldbrand (groß)",
  "Rettungswagen: 1, Notfalleinsatzfahrzeug: 0") – bind it next to
  `einsatz.stichwort` on the wall display or include it in the push
  notification/TTS announcement, so members don't have to memorize every
  keyword.
- **Trigger automations the instant an alarm comes in.** Watch
  `einsatz.alarmAktiv` (or `info.connection` together with it) in a
  script/blockly rule to switch on lights in the vehicle hall, open a
  gate/door, send a push notification (e.g. via a Telegram/Pushover
  adapter) with `einsatz.stichwort`/`einsatz.beschreibung` + `einsatz.ort`,
  or flash a smart-light scene – all a few seconds after the actual pager
  alert, no polling required since ioBroker state changes fire instantly.
- **Announce the alarm out loud.** `einsatz.tts.last` is a ready-to-play
  absolute mp3 URL; point a `sonos`/`snapcast`/`text2speech`-style
  automation at it (or just play the URL directly) to have the incident
  announced over building speakers the moment `io.playtts` fires –
  useful where members aren't all looking at a screen.
- **Live headcount / feedback board.** The `einsatz.rueckmeldungAnzahl.*`
  counters (per role: EK/GF/ZF/VF, per qualification: AGT/FZF/MA/MED)
  update in real time as responders confirm via the app – bind them to
  gauge or number widgets for an at-a-glance "who's coming" overview
  during the response.
- **Post-incident review / statistics.** `einsatz.json.history10` keeps
  the last 10 completed incidents as a flat table – bind it to a second
  VIS view or export it periodically (e.g. via a script reading the
  state on `io.standby`) to keep a longer-running log or feed incident
  counts into a dashboard/statistics adapter.
- **Route/vehicle overview on a map.** `einsatz.json.routen` carries
  each responding station's `lat`/`lon` and `color` – bind it to a VIS
  map widget for a quick visual of who is en route, independent of the
  WAIP-Web map itself.
- **Bridge into other ioBroker automations.** Because every field is a
  plain ioBroker state, it composes with anything else already running
  in the instance – forward `einsatz.*` into a smart-home scene engine,
  a Grafana/InfluxDB history for response-time analysis, or a
  Node-RED-style flow via the ioBroker MQTT adapter, without writing a
  single line against the WAIP-Web API.

## Features

- Connects to the `/waip` namespace via `socket.io-client`, registers via
  `emit('WAIP', monitorId)` once (relies on `REGISTRATION_TIMEOUT_MS`
  as a fallback rather than repeated emits, since a redundant emit only
  makes the server reply again without improving delivery reliability)
- Manual reconnect handling (the library's own auto-reconnect is
  disabled) with a configurable delay
- Registration timeout with an audit log (`debug.monitorAudit`)
- Geodata normalization (wgs84 fields, `position`, or GeoJSON `geometry`
  → centroid)
- History of the last 10 completed incidents (`einsatz.json.history10`)
- Separate handlers for alarm (`io.new_waip`), feedback (`io.new_rmld`),
  routes (`io.routes`), TTS (`io.playtts`) and standby (`io.standby`)
- Automatic session-cookie management (see below), so alarm delivery
  keeps working indefinitely without an open browser session
- Server-restart detection via `io.version`, with automatic session
  refresh + reconnect
- Incident, feedback, route and alerted-resource data available as
  separate, flat JSON arrays under `einsatz.json.*` – no nesting, so VIS
  table widgets can bind to them directly
- Aggregated feedback counters per role/capability, mirroring the live
  badges on the web UI
- Clean state on every restart: all states are actively reset to their
  empty value (`false`/`0`/`null`/`[]`) on adapter start, except
  `einsatz.json.history10` and `debug.monitorAudit` (both kept across
  restarts). Note that if the adapter restarts while an incident is
  actively running, its live fields (`einsatz.*`) are cleared too and
  only repopulate once the server sends the next event for that
  incident.
- Stale-data protection: when a new incident starts before the previous
  one's routes/feedback events for the *new* incident have arrived,
  `einsatz.json.routen`/`.rueckmeldungen` and the feedback counters are
  cleared immediately rather than waiting for those events. And if
  `io.standby` is ever missed for an incident (e.g. due to a disconnect
  at the wrong moment), a watchdog automatically finalizes the incident
  once its `ablaufzeit` has passed by more than a grace period
  (60 seconds), instead of leaving stale "active" data indefinitely.
- Only ever shows the single most recently active incident; multiple
  concurrently active incidents can currently only be viewed via the
  WAIP-Web instance's own dashboard
- Optional plain-language description for `einsatz.stichwort`
  (`einsatz.beschreibung`), resolved locally from a user-maintained
  keyword table plus an optional decoder for the `R<RTW>N<NEF>`
  rescue-service keyword scheme used by several dispatch
  centers - see [Rescue-service keywords](#rescue-service-keywords)

## Configuration

In the admin UI of the adapter instance, settings are grouped across
three tabs: **Connection**, **Rescue-service keywords** and **Keyword
descriptions** – see below for all three.

### Connection

| Field | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| WAIP server URL | Base URL of the WAIP-Web instance | `https://wachalarm.leitstelle-lausitz.de` |
| Monitor ID | Picked from a live dropdown, fetched from the configured server's `/waip/` overview page and grouped by Leitstelle/Kreis/Träger/Wache; manual entry stays possible if the server can't be reached. Empty/`0` = global monitor (all incidents) | *(empty)* |
| Registration timeout (s) | Time until a missing registration confirmation is logged | `10` |
| Reconnect delay (s) | Wait time before a manual reconnect after disconnect/error | `5` |

The session keepalive interval is **not configurable** – it's derived
fully automatically on every renewal from the cookie lifetime the server
reports (min. 55s, max. 5 min., matching `/js/session_keepalive.js` on
the site itself).

### Why a session cookie is needed

The WAIP-Web server ties alarm delivery to an Express session cookie,
which a browser renews automatically every few minutes via a bundled
script. A plain Socket.IO client never gets this cookie automatically –
the adapter therefore fetches it itself via `GET /session/keepalive` and
attaches it to the Socket.IO connection.

According to the WAIP-Web source code, the cookie's lifetime is
**configurable per instance via an environment variable** (server
default: 60 seconds; this instance apparently uses 10 minutes) – a fixed
renewal interval would therefore potentially be wrong for other WAIP-Web
instances. The adapter instead derives the actual interval **adaptively**
from the expiry time the server reports on every call (80% of the
observed lifetime, at least 55 seconds, at most a fixed 5-minute ceiling)
– the exact same clamping that `/js/session_keepalive.js` on the site
itself uses.

### Rescue-service keywords

`einsatz.stichwort` is passed through unchanged from the server as a
bare code (e.g. `B2`, `H:VU mit P`) – WAIP-Web itself doesn't explain
what it means, and there is no nationwide standard: every dispatch
center uses its own keyword catalog. `einsatz.beschreibung` fills that
gap **entirely locally**, no data is sent anywhere. This tab is the
first of two sources checked, in order (see
[Keyword descriptions](#keyword-descriptions) for the second):

**Rescue-service decoding** (admin checkbox, off by default): if the
keyword matches the pattern `R<RTW-count>N<NEF-count>[p][f][-NT]`
(e.g. `R1N0` → "Rettungswagen: 1, Notfalleinsatzfahrzeug: 0"), a
description is generated automatically. Two spellings of the `p`/`f`/`NT`
part are recognized: without a space and with a hyphen before `NT`
(e.g. `R1N1p`, `R1N0-NT`, see
[Leitstelle Lausitz's documented explanation](https://www.leitstelle-lausitz.de/anpassung-der-einsatzstichworte-rettungsdienst/)
of it), and with a space and without a hyphen (e.g. `R1N1 p`, `R1N0 nt`,
as used by the IRLS Brandenburg) – this scheme (in either spelling) is
used by several German dispatch centers, not just these two – only
enable it if your dispatch center actually uses one of these patterns.
The text for each part is itself configurable (5 additional text
fields appear once the checkbox is enabled), since the adapter is
multi-language and these labels aren't translated automatically:

| Part | Meaning | Default label |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `R<n>` | Number of ambulances (Rettungswagen) | `Rettungswagen` |
| `N<n>` | Number of emergency vehicles (Notfalleinsatzfahrzeug) | `Notfalleinsatzfahrzeug` |
| `p` suffix | Polytrauma | `Polytrauma` |
| `f` suffix | First responder included | `First Responder` |
| `-NT`/` nt` suffix | Special ambulance transport | `Notfalltransport mit Notfallkrankenwagen` |

### Keyword descriptions

Checked only if the decoder on the [Rescue-service keywords](#rescue-service-keywords)
tab didn't match: a list of `{keyword pattern, description, match type}`
rows – match type is `starts with` or `contains`, comparison is
case-insensitive, and if several rows match, the **most specific
(longest) pattern wins automatically** – row order has no effect on
matching, so the table can be freely sorted by keyword (click the
column header) without changing behavior. The table is pre-filled
with an example fire/rescue keyword list (`B:...`/`H:...`) as a
starting point only – it is **not** confirmed to match any specific
dispatch center's real catalog, edit or fully replace it as needed.
To back up or transfer this table, use ioBroker's standard instance
configuration export/import (JSON). After using that import,
**reload the Admin page** before checking this table – the open
config dialog doesn't refresh it from an external import
automatically (a state-sync limitation of the Admin table component
itself, not something this adapter controls).

If neither this table nor the decoder above match, `einsatz.beschreibung`
is simply `null` - not an error.

## States (under `waip-web.0.*`)

Feedback and routes are 1:n lists per incident. They are stored as
**flat** JSON arrays under `einsatz.json.*` (no nested objects/arrays
inside a row) so they can be bound directly to VIS table widgets –
complemented by quick-to-bind counters so bindings and triggers don't
need JSON parsing at all.

### info

| State | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `connection` | boolean | Standard ioBroker indicator: connection to the WAIP server active |

### status

| State | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `connected` | boolean | Socket.IO connection technically established |
| `registeredMonitor` | string | Monitor ID last registered with the server |
| `registeredMonitorName` | string | Display name of that monitor, without the ID (e.g. "Leitstelle: Lausitz"); resolved once at startup from the same `/waip/` overview page as the admin dropdown, `null` if it couldn't be resolved |
| `registrationAccepted` | boolean | `true` once the first event was received, `false` right after connecting or once the registration timeout elapses |
| `registrationPending` | boolean | `true` right after connecting while a response from the server is still awaited, `false` once accepted or timed out |

### einsatz

Flat fields of the currently running incident. Cleared (`null`/`0`) on
`io.standby`, matching the official frontend – `alarmAktiv` is therefore
a reliable switch for whether these fields currently hold real live data.
The most recently finished incident remains available via
`einsatz.json.history10`:

> **Note:** The adapter always reflects only the single most recently
> active incident (`einsatz.*` / `einsatz.json.current`) – matching the
> official WAIP-Web frontend's alarm monitor. WAIP-Web can, in principle,
> have several incidents active at the same time (e.g. two alerts coming
> in close together). These states are **not an array of concurrently
> running incidents** – they get overwritten by each new `io.new_waip`
> event, so a second incident running in parallel is currently not
> visible through this adapter. A complete overview of all currently
> active incidents is, for now, only available via the connected
> WAIP-Web instance's own dashboard.

> **Note:** WAIP-Web's server only fills `einsatznummer`, `objekt`/
> `objektteil`, `besonderheiten`, `strasse`/`hausnummer`,
> `einsatzdetails` and the permission flag for **logged-in** clients
> (`db_user_check_permission_for_waip()` in the server's own
> `server/waip.js`) - since this adapter connects without a login by
> design (see [About this adapter](#about-this-adapter)), the server
> always sends these blank/`false`. They are therefore not exposed as
> states at all rather than permanently carrying dead values.

| State | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `alarmAktiv` | boolean | `true` since the last `io.new_waip`, `false` since the last `io.standby` |
| `restzeit` | number (s) | Remaining seconds until `ablaufzeit`, updated every second |
| `id` | number | Internal incident ID |
| `uuid` | string | Unique incident UUID (also used to associate feedback) |
| `einsatzart` | string | e.g. "Brandeinsatz" (fire), "Hilfeleistungseinsatz" (technical assistance), "Rettungseinsatz" (rescue/EMS), "Krankentransport" (patient transport) |
| `stichwort` | string | Alarm keyword |
| `beschreibung` | string | Description for `stichwort`, resolved locally (not sent by the server) - see [Rescue-service keywords](#rescue-service-keywords)/[Keyword descriptions](#keyword-descriptions) below. `null` if nothing matched |
| `ort` | string | Location/town |
| `ortsteil` | string | District (if different from `ort`) |
| `zeitstempel` | string (date) | Alarm time |
| `ablaufzeit` | string (date) | End of the standby display duration, basis for `restzeit` |
| `sondersignal` | number | `1` = special signal (lights & siren), otherwise none |
| `latitude` / `longitude` | number | Incident location (normalized from wgs84 fields or GeoJSON centroid) |
| `routenGesamt` | number | Number of routes in the current incident |
| `rueckmeldungGesamt` | number | Total feedback count for the current incident |
| `rueckmeldungAnzahl.ek` | number | Feedback count as team member ("Einsatzkraft") |
| `rueckmeldungAnzahl.gf` | number | Feedback count as crew leader ("Gruppenführer") |
| `rueckmeldungAnzahl.zf` | number | Feedback count as division chief ("Zugführer") |
| `rueckmeldungAnzahl.vf` | number | Feedback count as group commander ("Verbandsführer") |
| `rueckmeldungAnzahl.agt` | number | Feedback count with breathing-apparatus qualification ("Atemschutzgeräteträger") |
| `rueckmeldungAnzahl.fzf` | number | Feedback count as vehicle commander ("Fahrzeugführer") |
| `rueckmeldungAnzahl.ma` | number | Feedback count as driver/operator ("Maschinist") |
| `rueckmeldungAnzahl.med` | number | Feedback count with a medical qualification |

### einsatz.json

Flat JSON objects/arrays, one level deep at most, meant to be bound
directly to VIS table widgets (nested structures like a plain
`{routen, rueckmeldungen, ...}` object generally aren't rendered by
those widgets). `routen`/`rueckmeldungen`/`emAlarmiert`/`emWeitere` only
ever hold the *current* incident's data – they are cleared (`[]`) on
`io.standby` and are **not** part of the history. As with `einsatz.*`
above, `current` only ever holds the single most recently active
incident – see the note in the [`einsatz`](#einsatz) section.

| State | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `current` | string (JSON array) | Current incident's flat data: the same 12 fields as the individual `einsatz.*` states above (`id` … `zeitstempel`, plus `beschreibung`, `lat`/`lon`), plus `registeredMonitor`/`registeredMonitorName` (the monitor the adapter was registered to at the time), bundled as one object inside a single-element array (`[]` if no incident is active) – the array wrapper is needed because most table widgets require an array at the root, not a bare object |
| `history10` | string (JSON array) | Last 10 completed incidents, same shape as `current`, one array entry per incident, written on `io.standby` |
| `routen` | string (JSON array) | Routes of the current incident; each entry has `nr_wache`, `name_wache`, `color`, `lat`, `lon` (`position` resolved to flat `lat`/`lon`) |
| `rueckmeldungen` | string (JSON array) | Feedback entries of the current incident, as received from the server |
| `emAlarmiert` | string (JSON array) | Alerted resources of the current incident; each entry has `name`, `zeit`, `wache`, `zeit_alarmierung_iso`, `zeit_ausgerueckt_iso` |
| `emWeitere` | string (JSON array) | Additional resources of the current incident, same shape as `emAlarmiert` |

### einsatz.tts

Voice announcement (`io.playtts`) for the currently running incident –
lives under `einsatz` rather than its own top-level channel since it has
no meaning without an incident. No history: a TTS announcement only
matters in the moment, so only the most recent one is kept.

| State | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `last` | string (URL) | Full absolute URL of the most recent voice announcement's mp3 file. The server sends only a bare (often relative) path meant to be used as `audio.src` in a browser that shares its origin; the adapter resolves that against the configured WAIP server URL so the link also works outside the WAIP-Web page (e.g. in a VIS audio widget) |
| `lastTimestamp` | string (date) | Time of the last announcement |

### debug

| State | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `lastEvent` | string (JSON array) | Last received socket event (name + timestamp), for connection diagnostics; single-element array (`[]` if none yet), for VIS table-widget compatibility |
| `normalizedPosition` | string (JSON array) | Result of the geodata normalization for the last `io.new_waip` event, as a flat single-element `[{lat, lon}]` array (both `null` if no valid position could be derived; `[]` if no event yet), for VIS table-widget compatibility |
| `rawPayloadShort` | string | Preview (500 characters) of the raw, unnormalized `io.new_waip` payload |
| `ignoredCount` | number | Count of discarded events (payload explicitly named a different monitor ID) |
| `monitorAudit` | string (JSON array) | Chronological log of connect/registration/reconnect events (200 entries) |
| `sessionExpires` | string (date) | Expiry time of the session cookie as of the last renewal |
| `lastError` | string | Last error message reported by the server (`io.error`); plain text, not JSON, as the server sends this as a bare string |
| `serverVersion` | string | Last reported server instance ID (`io.version`); a change suggests a server restart |

## Logging

All log text is in English. Repeatable failure conditions (session-cookie
renewal, WAIP registration, the Socket.IO connection, a wrong-monitor
event flood) are logged once at `warn` on first occurrence, then at
`debug` while they persist, and once at `info` on recovery – matching the
[official ioBroker logging guideline](https://github.com/ioBroker/ioBroker.docs/blob/master/docs/en/dev/adapterdev.md#logging).

See **[LOGGING.md](LOGGING.md)** for the full reference of every log
message the adapter can produce, grouped by level, with its cause and an
example.

## Changelog

### 0.7.25 (2026-08-23)

- Updated the admin UI text for the [rescue-service decoder](#rescue-service-keywords)
  to reflect the two supported keyword spellings added in 0.7.23
  (Leitstelle Lausitz `R1N1p`/`R1N0-NT` and IRLS Brandenburg `R1N1 p`/
  `R1N0 nt`) - the checkbox label/help and the NT suffix label/help
  previously only mentioned the hyphenated no-space form.

### 0.7.24 (2026-08-23)

- Extended the default [keyword table](#keyword-descriptions) with two
  more Brandenburg spelling variants: `B:Gebäude-Groß` and
  `B:Gebäude-Klein` (hyphen instead of space, as used by some dispatch
  centers) - same descriptions as the existing `B:Gebäude groß`/`B:Gebäude
  klein` entries. Only affects the shipped example table for new
  installs - existing configured tables are untouched.

### 0.7.23 (2026-08-23)

- Extended the default [keyword table](#keyword-descriptions) with the
  29 `K`/`V`/`M`/`S` keywords (Krankentransport, Verlegung, MANV,
  Sonderstichwörter) from the IRLS Brandenburg rescue-service catalog
  (v2.7) - previously only the `R<ambulance>N<physician-vehicle>`
  scheme and the Brand/THL (`B:`/`H:`) table were covered, so
  `einsatz.beschreibung` stayed `null` for these.
- Fixed the [rescue-service keyword](#rescue-service-keywords) decoder
  (`decodeRettungsdienstStichwort`): it only accepted the Leitstelle
  Lausitz spelling without a space (`R1N1p`, `R1N0-NT`) and silently
  returned `null` for the IRLS Brandenburg spelling with a space
  (`R1N1 p`, `R1N0 nt`) - both are now recognized.
- Only affects the shipped example table and the decoder logic for
  new installs/upgrades - existing configured tables are untouched.

### 0.7.22 (2026-08-23)

- Extended the default [keyword table](#keyword-descriptions) with
  `H:Person-TMR` (technical human rescue) and corrected three entries
  whose pattern didn't match the actual dispatch keyword:
  `H:Flugunfall` → `H:Flugzeugunfall` (`klein`/`groß`), `H:Öl Wasser`
  → `H:Öl auf Wasser`, `H:Rettung aus Höhen/Tiefen` → `H:Rettung aus
  Höhen und Tiefen` (source: Regionalleitstellen Brandenburg keyword
  list, v7.1). Only affects the shipped example table for new
  installs - existing configured tables are untouched.

### 0.7.21 (2026-08-23)

- Removed the keyword table's CSV export/import: a bug in ioBroker
  Admin's own `table` component corrupted German umlauts on CSV
  import (e.g. `Ã¤`/`Ã` instead of `ä`/`ß`) - confirmed to be entirely
  inside the Admin UI, not this adapter's code. Use ioBroker's
  standard instance configuration export/import (JSON) instead - see
  [Keyword descriptions](#keyword-descriptions) for the reload caveat
  after using it.
- Split the admin configuration UI into 3 tabs -
  [Connection](#connection), [Rescue-service
  keywords](#rescue-service-keywords),
  [Keyword descriptions](#keyword-descriptions) - each with a
  matching icon, replacing the single combined settings page.
- Documentation: restructured the configuration section of the
  README to mirror the 3 admin tabs, fixed a stale reference to the
  removed CSV feature, and added a couple of small clarifications
  (mentioned `einsatz.beschreibung` in the practical-use-cases
  section, mentioned the 3-tab structure up front). All code comments
  in `main.js` are now bilingual (German + English).

### 0.7.20 (2026-08-22)

- Added `einsatz.beschreibung`: a plain-language description for
  `einsatz.stichwort`, resolved entirely locally (also included in
  `einsatz.json.current`/`.history10`). Two sources, in order:
  - An optional decoder for the `R<RTW>N<NEF>[p][f][-NT]` rescue-service
    keyword scheme used by several dispatch centers - the label for
    each part is fully configurable via 5 new text fields.
  - A user-maintained keyword table (admin table, CSV export/import,
    pre-filled with an example fire/rescue keyword list) where the
    most specific (longest) matching pattern wins automatically,
    regardless of row order - the table can be freely sorted by
    keyword.
  - `null` if nothing matches. See
    [Alarm keyword descriptions](#alarm-keyword-descriptions).

### 0.7.19 (2026-08-22)

- Fixed a bug where incoming feedback (`io.new_rmld`) was silently
  dropped as "wrong monitor" whenever the responding station's number
  (`wache_nr`) differed from the registered monitor ID:
  `payloadMonitorMatch()` incorrectly treated `wache_nr`/`wache_id`/
  `wacheId` as monitor-identifying fields, but confirmed against the
  WAIP-Web server source, `wache_nr` on a feedback event is the station
  number of the crew that submitted it, unrelated to the monitor/
  dispatch-center ID. Removed these three from the match candidates -
  alarms and routes were never affected (they don't carry these
  fields).

### 0.7.18 (2026-08-22)

- Fixed `debug.lastEvent`/`debug.normalizedPosition` to hold a
  single-element JSON array instead of a bare object (matching
  `einsatz.json.current`), for direct VIS table-widget compatibility,
  and to correctly initialize to `[]` instead of `null` on a fresh
  install/restart.
- Removed `einsatz.einsatznummer`/`.objekt`/`.objektteil`/
  `.besonderheiten`/`.strasse`/`.hausnummer`/`.einsatzdetails`/
  `.permissions` (and the corresponding fields in
  `einsatz.json.current`/`.history10`): confirmed via the WAIP-Web
  server source (`server/waip.js`,
  `db_user_check_permission_for_waip()`) that these fields are only
  ever populated for logged-in clients - since this adapter connects
  anonymously by design, they were always empty/`false`. Removed
  instead of permanently carrying dead states - see the note in the
  [`einsatz`](#einsatz) section.

### 0.7.17 (2026-08-22)

- Fixed `cleanupObsoleteObjects()` incorrectly deleting and recreating
  the `einsatz.json` channel on every restart (it wasn't checking
  `obj.type`, so the current channel object was mistaken for a leftover
  state from before the 0.7.15 migration).
- Fixed a spurious `status.registrationPending` "no existing object"
  warning that could occur if the adapter was stopped before object
  initialization had finished.
- Reduced WAIP registration from three emits to a single emit - Socket.IO
  already delivers reliably once connected, and the existing registration
  timeout remains as the safety net for the rare case it doesn't confirm.
- `permissions` inside `einsatz.json.current`/`.history10` is now always
  stringified consistently with the standalone `einsatz.permissions`
  state, and `einsatz.json.current` is wrapped in a single-element array
  (VIS table widgets require an array at the root, not a bare object).
- Fixed `einsatz.json.history10`/`debug.monitorAudit` staying `null`
  instead of `[]` on a fresh install (they're excluded from the
  per-restart reset to preserve history, which previously also meant
  they were never initialized at all on first install).
- Added `registeredMonitor`/`registeredMonitorName` fields to
  `einsatz.json.current`/`.history10`.
- Reworked logging: translated all remaining German log text to
  English; implemented the official first-occurrence-`warn`/
  repeat-`debug`/recovery-`info` pattern for recurring failures (session
  cookie, registration, connection); capped noisy Socket.IO ping/pong
  debug logging; a sustained flood of wrong-monitor events now escalates
  to `warn` instead of staying at `info` indefinitely. See
  [LOGGING.md](LOGGING.md) for the full reference.
- Documentation: added a table of contents, a practical-use-cases
  section, a known-limitation note (only the single most recently active
  incident is shown - see [`einsatz`](#einsatz)), and enforced the
  changelog's own 5-entry limit.
